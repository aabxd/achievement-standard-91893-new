    <h2>Junior Years</h2>
    <p>The first two years of New Zealand Highschool are about developing
      the essential skills and work quality for NCEA. There is an opportunity
      to take part in NCEA during junior years by applying for a senior subject
      or partake in Internals and/or Externals. This can be done through the
      teacher's discretion. Subjects such as Mathematics might have
      certain pre-requisites in order to gain entry to the senior subject.</p>

    <h2>The National Certificate of Educational Achievement</h2>
    <p>Once students complete their junior years in highschool, They are eligible
      to be involved in NCEA. In NCEA, students will gain credits through assessments
      known as 'Internals' and 'Externals'. Externals generally come in the form of an exam.
      The remaining three years of secondary highschool will be dedicated to
      passing NCEA Levels 1, 2 and 3. The list below shows the requirements
      in passing each level:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Level 1: 80 credits</li>
      <li>Level 2: 80 credits (60 Level 2 credits, 20 from Level 1)</li>
      <li>Level 3: 80 credits (60 Level 3 credits, 20 from Level 2)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Students doing NCEA are able to work across multiple levels regardless of grade,
      Though they are highly encouraged to spend a year passing each level.</p>
    <h3>Endorsements</h3>
    <p>Endorsements of a subject can be attained by reaching a certain amount of
      credits. Subjects can be endorsed with Merit (composed of both Merit and Excellence
      credits) and Excellence. At least 3 credits from an Internal and an External must be attained
      in order to get a Subject Endorsement.</p>
    <h3>Reconsiderations</h3>
    <p>If the student isn't compliant with their final grade in an external,
      they can be reassessed in a 'reconsideration'.
      Reconsiderations cost $30 NZD which is refunded if the student receives
      a higher grade. As of now, some assessments may have an opportunity
      to do a 'resubmission' for a higher grade should the quality of the
      student's work be borderline with the higher grade.</p>
  </section>
  <section id="four">
    <h2>University Entrance</h2>
    <p>The prerequisites for most University Entrances include:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Achieved NCEA Level 3</li>
      <li>10 Literacy Credits (5 reading & 5 writing) which can be attained
        from L2 and L3</li>
      <li>14 credits from three University Entrance approved subjects</li>
      <li>10 Numeracy credits from Level 1 and above</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Should the student not meet these requirements, the NCEA credits gained
      from level 3 will be used to tally up a 'Guaranteed Entry Score'
      for entry into a undergraduate programme.
      The score will be calculated by awarding points as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Excellence = 4 points</li>
      <li>Merit = 3 points</li>
      <li>Achieved = 2 points</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The minimum Gauranteed Entry Score for all undergraduate degrees is 150
      points. A total of 180 points is required for the Bachelor of Architectural
      Studies and the Bachelor of Building Science. Only a maximum of 24 credits
      from a UE approved subject can be counted for GES.</p>
