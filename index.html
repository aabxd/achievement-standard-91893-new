      <h2>Welcome</h2>
      <p>NCEA Guide is a website dedicated to making your secondary Highschool
        experience a smooth one. This website covers the essentials of the National
        Certificate of Educational Achievement or 'NCEA' for short which is the pathway
        to New Zealand's universities.</p>

      <h2>The NZ curriculum</h2>
      <p>The New Zealand Curriculum sets the direction for teaching and learning
        in English-medium New Zealand schools. Students will partake in
        NCEA Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 during Years 11, 12, and 13.</p>

    <div class="box three">
      <h2>Process</h2>
      <p>NCEA is a process that primarily revolves around secondary schools to
        prepare students for University. Students partake in assessments where
        they will be marked on the quality of their work. These assessments are
        composed of 'Internals' which are marked by the school, and 'Externals'
        which are marked by the NZQA organization. By completing these
        assessments, Students will gain credits. These credits are mandatory in
        passing levels. There are 3 NCEA Levels (Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3)
        in secondary schools that students must pass, especially Level 3, in order
        to gain Univeristy Entrance. There are four possible grades a student can get
        in partaking an assessment: Not Achieved, Achieved, Achieved with
        Merit, and Achieved with Excellence. Credits gained above
        the 'Not Achieved' grade will contribute to passing NCEA levels. A set amount of
        credits is needed to pass a certain level. In Level 2 and Level 3, credits from the
        previous level can be used to pass that level.</p>
